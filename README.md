Wow, just wrapped up 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Antes del cuerpo, and honestly? My brain's a bit fried. Like... it's good, right? But damn, I need a breather. You ever get that feeling where you're 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 something so artsy that your brain's doing acrobatics just trying to keep up? That's me right now, 100%.

So, it kicks off and I’m like, okay, I think I get where this is headed. But then boom, it flips! And you're just there wondering if you somehow 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the wrong  . But it's the right one, and you just gotta roll with it. It's got all these deep layers and hidden meanings. Probably. I mean, do they even know what they’re doing half the time in these 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮𝘴? Or are they just tossing stuff out there to see if it sticks?

> Anyway, the whole existential crisis vibe is real—like, what am I doing with my life kinda real. You 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   and suddenly, you're reevaluating all your choices. Is it really that deep, or am I just sleep-deprived? Haha.

Oh, and can we talk about those shots? Stunning, right? The way they frame the scenes makes you feel like you're in some alternate universe. I can't even with the, like, color grading or whatever. So moody, so intense. But seriously, who decided that muted grays were the new black? I felt like I was in a dream sequence half the time.

Ok, but get this—we've got characters you're trying to root for, but half the time you're asking yourself if anyone here is actually worth rooting for. It's like, are these peeps trying to figure themselves out or just spiraling into oblivion and taking us along for the ride? Either way, I'm invested.

int x = 42; // Why am I even writing this?

So yeah, that's where I'm at. A bit exhausted, but kinda inspired? Maybe. Gonna sleep on it. Dream up some theories or whatever. Catch you later!
